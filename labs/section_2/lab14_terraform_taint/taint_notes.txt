Terraform Taint

- You can use the cli terraform taint command to mark resources that have been modified
manually.

- If a resource has been tainted, then the next terraform apply will destory and recreate
the resource.

- You must make sure that any resource that rely on the changes made to the tainted resource
will also be affected.
